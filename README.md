# **MKDataDetector for Swift**
A simple convenience wrapper for data detection from natural language text.

Currently in the _**design phase**_.

## Purpose

While **Apple's** `NSDataDetector` is useful for extracting useful information from natural language text, it can be cumbersome to use and a little difficult to adopt. To circumvent this issue, we are developing an encapsulating framework called `MKDataDetector` to streamline the original API and simplify its usage and application.

## Usage

To keep things simple, `MKDataDetector` is packaged as a set of extensions that compartmentalize its following capabilities:

* Spelling - spell-checking
* Grammar - grammar checking
* Date - date(s) extraction
* Address - address(es) extraction
* Link - link(s) extraction
* Replacement - symbol replacement, such as **(c) -> Â©**
* Correction - spell-correction suggestions
* Transit Information - flight information extraction, etc.

In addition to extracting these features, the framework also provides convenience functions to manipulate and organize this data.

### Initialization

You can declare an instance as follows:
```swift
let dataDetectorService: MKDataDetectorService = MKDataDetectorService()
```

### Performing Analysis

For convenience, a generic `AnalysisResult<T>` structure is consistently returned for extraction/analysis results.

For instance, to extract dates from some text (`String`):
```swift
if let results = dataDetectorService.extractDates(withTextBody: <someText>) {
    for result in results {
        // do some stuff
    }
}
```

Or, to extract dates from multiple sources of text (`[String]`):
```swift
if let results = dataDetectorService.extractDates(withTextBodies: [<someText>, <someText>, ...]) {
    for textBodyResults in results {
        if let tBResults = textBodyResults {
            for result in tBResults {
                // do some stuff
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Further usage being decided upon.
